# website-screenshotter-script-puppeteer

Script that grabs a screenshot of a website url

run the script in your terminal using the following:
'node screenshot DOMAIN_NAME'
Example:
'node screenshot google.com'

The http:// is already prefixed in the script, so only the domain name is required in the command

The script will then save a screenshot of the website url you entered in the 'screenshots' directory

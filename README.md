# website-screenshotter-script-puppeteer

First install all dependencies from the terminal with 'npm i'

Script that grabs a screenshot of a website url

run the script in your terminal using the following:
'node screenshot rubenverster.com'
Example:
'node screenshot google.com'

The 'https:/'/ is already prefixed in the script when searching for a webite, so only the domain name is required in the screenshot command

A screenshot of the website will be saved in the 'screenshots' directory
